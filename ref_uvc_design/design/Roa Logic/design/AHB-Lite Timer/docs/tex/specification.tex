\section{Functional Description}\label{functional-description}

The AHB-Lite Timer IP is a fully parameterised Timer-tick core,
featuring a single AHB-Lite Slave interface and a single multiplexed
Interrupt output signal.

The Timer IP is intended to generate CPU interrupts at regular time
intervals, for timed events such as time keeping, task/context switches,
and sleep().

The number of timers and Address \& Data width of the AHB-Lite interface
are specified via parameters defined at compile time.

The time base of the timers is common to all timers and defined at
runtime by writing to the \texttt{PRESCALER} register. Individual timer alarms
may then set via the \texttt{TIMECMP[n]} registers. All timers are
permanently enabled however a separate \texttt{IENABLE} register allows any
triggered counter output to be masked.

The user may determine both the status of the \texttt{TIMERS} including which
timer has generated an interrupt via a read operation to the AHB-Lite
interface.
