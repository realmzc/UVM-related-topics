*Project:     Common Agent

*Description:
              cagt is a SystemVerilog generic agent, implemented based on UVM methodology.
              This agent can be easily extended to create very fast an UVM based agent for any protocol.
              The minimum required effort is to:

	              - declare the interface and a virtual interface type
	              - declare driving and monitoring items
	              - implement task for driving just one item - see drive_transaction() task in the driver
	              - implement task for monitoring just one item - see collect_transaction() task from the monitor
	              - implement function for detecting start of reset - see wait_reset_start() function from agent configuration
	              - implement function for detecting end of reset - see wait_reset_end() function from agent configuration
