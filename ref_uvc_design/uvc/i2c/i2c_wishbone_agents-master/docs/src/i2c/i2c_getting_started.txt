Title: Getting Started With I2C

_Initial Integration_ -
Please follow the instructions in the <I2C Package Integration> description. 

_Working with the I2C Agents_ -
The agents configurations are preset to default values to allow an
initial integration. By using the default configuration, the agents will
begin to work in an environment without any modifications. Once you are 
satisfied the integration is complete, review the members and constraints of the <i2c_cfg>, 
<i2c_master_cfg>, <i2c_slave_cfg> configuration classes and the <i2c_sequence_item> 
to adapt changes required for the current working environment. 

_Release Notes_ -
Please review the <I2C Release Notes> for updates and limitations of the agents.
