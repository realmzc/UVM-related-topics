This example shows how you can use the OVM factory to override sequences
either by type (i.e. globally) or by an instance. The instance approach relies
on you thinking about overriding wherever you create the sequence via the
factory.

To compile and run the simulation, please use the make file:

make all - Compile and run
make build - Compile only
make sim  - Run the simulation in command line mode

The Makefile assumes the use of Questa 10.0b or a later version with
built-in support for the UVM
