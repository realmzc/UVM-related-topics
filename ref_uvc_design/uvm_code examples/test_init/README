This example shows how to initialise the sequencer handles in a virtual sequence
from an initialisation method in a test.

The Makefile will compile the design and run the simulation withi versions of Questa from 10.0c onwards.

If you are using an earlier version of Questa, then the Makefile will need to be
modified to include the UVM source directory.

To compile and run type:

make
