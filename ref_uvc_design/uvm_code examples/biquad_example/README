This directory tree contains the BiQuad datapath functional coverage
example from the Verification Academy Coverage Cookbook.

The content of the example is as follows:

tb/agents/apb_agent - APB agent used in the UVM testbench
tb/agents/signal_agent - Signal generator agent
tb/tb - Top level testbench
tb/tests
tb/env
tb/registers
rtl - Contains a model of the BiQuad filter
sim - Simulation directory for the example, contains the Makefile

To compile and run the example:

cd sim
make

This will compile the model and the testbench and then run a smoke test.
This will return a UVM_TEST_PASSED message after about 2-3 mins of real time.

Other make options:

make guisim - Runs the smoke test in the Questa GUI
make soak_test - Runs the full biquad tests over several hours, should return a
                 100% functional coverage result.

Both these simulations produce a Questa ucdb file containing the functional coverage information.
